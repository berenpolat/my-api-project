My API Project
This project is a simple Node.js-based RESTful API built with Express.js. The API is designed to serve as a foundational example for creating, deploying, and managing APIs in the cloud using AWS EC2. The project demonstrates basic RESTful API principles by responding to HTTP GET requests with a simple "Hello, World" message.

Features:
Node.js & Express: A lightweight server built using Express.js for quick API development.
RESTful Endpoints: A basic GET endpoint (/) that returns a simple greeting.
Cloud Deployment: Deployed on AWS EC2 to demonstrate cloud-based API hosting.
Git Version Control: Fully integrated with GitHub for version control and collaboration.
